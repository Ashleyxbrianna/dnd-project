        start small. You can argue that the Essentials Kit and Starter Set are
        all you need to get going - which isn’t wrong. Those are great tools if
        you want to try it out. However, if you want to give the game a real
        shot, all you need for a literal lifetime of adventure is: the Player’s
        Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and the Monster Manual. To go any
        further than those intro kits, these three are needed.

        Also are you going to be the DM? If so, read up on all the things
        because you have the reigns.
